# pwa-web-push-notifications

# About :
Push notifications are a way to notify users of important events even if they are not using the application at the moment.
Push Notifications build on the Web Push standard and ServiceWorkers. 
When configured, a ServiceWorker will be activated by an incoming push notification.
It can then fetch updated data and display a notification to the user.
In this small POC, I have created small example of how to add Push-Notifications in simple Angular PWA Application.

# Front-End:
Angular(7.0) + PWA

# Back-End Server:
Node.js

# How to run ?
Clone the both repo's - front end and back end
Open two terminals 1 for front end and one for back end.
- In first terminal (Front_End)
Go to repo, do npm install and run ng serve command.
Run application locally using 4200 port - http://localhost:4200
- In second terminal (Back_End)
Go to repo, run npm install and run node server
