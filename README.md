# pwa-web-push-notifications

# About :
Push notifications are a way to notify users of important events even if they are not using the application at the moment.
Push Notifications build on the Web Push standard and ServiceWorkers. 
When configured, a ServiceWorker will be activated by an incoming push notification.
It can then fetch updated data and display a notification to the user.
In this small POC, I have created small example of how to add Push-Notifications in simple Angular PWA Application.

#Front-End
Angular(7.0) + PWA

#Back-End Server
Node.js
